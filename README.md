This project is a demonstration of the javascript skills that I have learned during the SD05 JavaScript & Front-End Web Development Course.

This game was inspired by one of my favorite childhood games: Snake (originally played on the Nokia cell phone).

Although the game is not fully complete, it is functional. 

I hope you enjoy playing :)

Cheers!
